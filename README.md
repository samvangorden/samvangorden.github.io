# Welcome!

I am a former software engineer turned data scientist after receiving my Masters of Science in Statistics. My love of mathematical analysis combined with my computational skills and experience as a data science instructor make me well-qualified to take on large scale analytics projects. Some of my recent work includes utilizing [large language models](#natural-language-processing) for named entity recognition and question answering and [reinforcement learning](#reinforcement-learning) for bot training.
