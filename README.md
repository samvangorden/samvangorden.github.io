# Welcome!

I am a former software engineer turned data scientist after receiving my Masters of Science in Statistics. My love of mathematical analysis combined with my computational skills and experience as a data science instructor make me well-qualified to take on large scale analytics projects. Some of my recent work includes utilizing large language models for named entity recognition and question answering and reinforcement learning for bot training (See [here](https://github.com/Svangorden13/Machine-Learning-Projects)).
