# Welcome!

I am a former software engineer turned data scientist after receiving my Masters of Science in Statistics. My love of mathematical analysis combined with my computational skills and experience as a data science instructor make me well-qualified to take on large scale analytics projects. Some of my recent work includes utilizing [large language models](#natural-language-processing) for named entity recognition and question answering and [reinforcement learning](#reinforcement-learning) for bot training.

## Work Experience

### LearningFuze, Irvine, CA - Data Science Instructor (01/2024-Present)
* Teaching two-module data science program covering topics such as Python, descriptive and inferential statistics, regression, (un)supervised learning, neural networks, and time series analysis
* Collaborating with existing data science team to restructure and enhance current curriculum to better fit the demands of an ever-changing data science job market
* Providing continuous feedback and question-answering to students enrolled, ensuring the success of our program as one of the top bootcamps in Southern California

### Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Kansas City, MO - Statistical Research Assistant (07/2022-04/2023)
* Developed Stata package that performs Bayesian Synthetic Control with MCMC optimization in order to measure the treatment effect and prediction intervals for economic indicators such as inflation and unemployment
* Researched interstate migration patterns in order to design economic policy that considers human movement due to economy-related factors

### Western Digital Corporation, Irvine, CA - Senior Software Engineer (07/2014-06/2021)
* Member of two SAFe Agile firmware test development teams, utilized a variety of programming languages, environments, and operating systems to ensure data integrity and feature functionality
* Developed production level code for firmware testing across seven different high-throughput and performance benchmark software frameworks
* Adapted testing infrastructure to run tests on multiple hard drives simultaneously, doubling potential test capacity
* Managed regression validation of new Linux environment changes routinely rolled out to thousands of cross-company stakeholders to ensure robust OS and driver changes
* Automated collection of test profile data and key performance metrics and used data to create online analytics dashboard that helped identify test gaps, allowing for up to 50% increase in failure detection rate
